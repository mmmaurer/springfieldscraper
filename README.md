# Springfieldscraper

Movie and tv script scaper for the movie script website [springfieldspringfield](https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/).

## Usage:

<code>python scraper.py [movie/series name] [m | tv] [outputpath (optional)]</code>

with the movie/series title connected by dashes (e.g. incredible-hulk-the); <code>m</code> for movie and <code>tv</code> for tv series scripts.

Note that there might be multiple series with the same title, so it may be necessary to add the year (e.g. 13-reasons-why-2017).
If in doubt, consult the springfieldspringfield website to see if the script(s) you are looking for are available.
